# Kubernetes Exploration

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is a container orchestration and management platform. Kubernetes is much more than that though - it can manage ingress to services and manage many different storage classes for various types of storage within the cluster.

In this series we'll investigate how to get a complete service up and running on a new kubernetes cluster that we set up ourselves. There's quite a lot to kubernetes and managed services like Amazon EKS and Azure's AKS offer a range of ingress and storage classes right out of the box. We'll need to get our hands dirty and install some of those for ourselves.
